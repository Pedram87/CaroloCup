\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:Conclusion}
This chapter summarizes the content of this report and gives a short conclusion about its main parts.

After a brief introduction on the topic of image processing, clustering and
pattern matching, the report discussed the design and actual implementation of
each of these topics showing the output images of all the steps of image
processing on an arbitrary lane. This discussion was followed by a chapter
where each image processing step's run-time property were shown with an example
on the resulting clusters and the input data for the control algorithm. The
final discussion was based on these results and pointed out several drawbacks
with possible solution for them. This discussion mainly covered the topic of
image processing and patter matching. Since the ideas and design presented in
this report were just the first step in a continuous development process, it
has its limitations and requires improvements.
