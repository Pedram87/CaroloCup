\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:Conclusion}
This chapter summarizes the content of this report and gives a short conclusion about its main parts.

After a brief introduction on the topic of image processing, clustering and
pattern matching, the report discussed the design and actual implementation of
each of these topics showing the output images of all the steps of image
processing on an arbitrary image. This discussion was followed by a chapter
where each image processing steps' run-time property were shown with an example
on the resulting clusters and the defined two solid and one dashed lines
for the control algorithm. The final discussion was based on these result and
pointed out several drawbacks with possible solution for them. This discussion
mainly covered the topic of image processing and patter matching. Since the
ideas and design presented in this report were just the first step in a
continuous improvement process, it has its limitations and requires
improvements.
