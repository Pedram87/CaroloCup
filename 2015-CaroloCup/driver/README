Based on your Ubuntu distribution(32bit or 64bit), extract one of the zip file.

1 - copy all the files into a directory on the hard disk
    (you need write access to decompress). For the following 
    steps, you need to be root!

2 - go to the directory you copied the files into and
    run the setup program script by typing (replace the
    wildcard with the actual version identifier of the 
    installer file)
    $> sh ./ueyesdk-setup*.run

3 - if installation succeeded, one may start the uEye daemon by typing
    '/etc/init.d/ueyeethdrc start' (you need to be root)
    To stop the uEye daemon, type
    '/etc/init.d/ueyeethdrc stop' (you need to be root)
    For USB uEye, replace 'ueyeethdrc' with 'ueyeusbdrc'.
    Alternatively, if one has a working graphical environment, the daemons may be
    controlled via the uEye Camera Manager (started as root)
